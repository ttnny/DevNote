Serialization: converting data-structured object into a format that can be safely stored or transmitted. E.g. Converting an in-memory object to JSON or XML.

Deserialization: reverse process of serialization

Parsing: Takes a stream of structured data as an input then does something with that input such as creating an in-memory structured data or executing a sequence of operations based on it. Compiling source code, linting or formatting code are also examples of parsing. Deserialization is a type of parsing.

Marshaling: Somtimes similar to serialization but more implying moving data rather than transforming data.
