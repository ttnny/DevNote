Serialization: converting data-structured object into a format that can be safely stored or transmitted. E.g. Converting an in-memory object to JSON or XML.

Deserialization: reverse process of serialization

Parsing: Takes a stream of structured data as an input then does something with that input such as creating an in-memory structured data or executing a sequence of operations based on it. Compiling source code, linting or formatting code are also examples of parsing. Deserialization is a type of parsing.

Marshaling: Compare to serialization, marshaling implies more about moving. It is about getting parameters from here to there. Definition of marshaling is broader than serialization. Marshaling can also record the state of an object and the codebase too.
